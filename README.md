GitHub Guide - Create a repository

I am just following the GitHub Guide to start my first repository.

As a quick introduction to myself, I am starting to explore 'Data Science' and the numerous programmes and tools to ultimately create a Machine Learning Trading Robot.

Any Forks and repositories on contained within my GitHub profile will be more of a collection of references and source materials (my way of organising my thoughts) that helps me understand what I need to achieve my goal.
